    title: "Understanding Tailwind CSS",
    content:
      "Tailwind CSS is a utility-first CSS framework packed with classes like flex, pt-4, text-center and rotate-90 that can be composed to build any design, directly in your markup. It's a different way to style websites that offers more flexibility and customization than traditional CSS frameworks.\n\nInstead of pre-designed components, Tailwind provides low-level utility classes that let you build completely custom designs without ever leaving your HTML. This approach allows for more flexibility and control over your design, and can lead to smaller CSS bundle sizes since you're only using what you need.",
